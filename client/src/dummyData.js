        longDesc: "Sombreros, like cowboy hats, were designed in response to the demands of the physical environment. The concept of a broad-brimmed hat worn by a rider on horseback can be seen as far back as the Mongolian horsemen of the 13th century, and in the Greek petasos two millennia before that.[3] In hot, sunny climates hats often have evolved wide brims. The exact origin of the Mexican sombrero is unknown, but it is usually accepted that the hat originated with mestizo cowboys in Central Mexico.[4] Although sombrero is usually taken to refer to the traditional Mexican headwear, the term sombrero predates this item of clothing, and has been applied to several differing styles of hat. Other types of hats known as sombrero can be found in South America and Spain, including the sombrero calañés, sombrero cordobés and sombrero de catite (Spain), and sombrero vueltiao (Colombia).",

Do you think it's the government trying to turn us into followers of the Rice-a-Roni god? That has to be the case. I mean think about it. Rice-a-Roni comes in a box. Box? Box rhymes with socks. Socks? Socks and sandles BUT WAIT crocs with socks? Everyone knows crocs with socks is one of the worst disasters to ever fall upon human civilization. So...who is responsible? It must be the Rice-a-Roni god. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",
